Cut the potatoes and carrots into small uniform cubes.
Place them in a large pot and fill with water.
Add salt and vinegar. Bring it to a boil over medium high heat, and then reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook until the potatoes are cooked through, about 15 minutes. Drain the potatoes and let it cool to room temperature.
Meanwhile, cut the sausage and pickles into small cubes, and chop the green onions.
Cut the hard-boiled eggs into small cubes as well.
