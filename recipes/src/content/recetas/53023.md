Soak herring in cold water for at least 1 hour. If very salty, repeat, changing the water each time.

Drain thoroughly and slice herring into bite-size pieces.

Place in a jar large enough to accommodate the pieces and cover with oil, allspice, peppercorns, and bay leaf. Close the jar.

Refrigerate for 2 to 3 days before eating. This will keep refrigerated up to 2 weeks.

Serve with finely chopped onion or onion slices, lemon, and parsley or dill.
