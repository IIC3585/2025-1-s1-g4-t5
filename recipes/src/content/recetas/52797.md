Cook potatoes - place potatoes in a pot of cold water, and bring to the boil. Boil 20 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. You know they are cooked when you can stick a knife in them and the knife goes straight through.
Combine harissa spice, olive oil, salt and pepper and lemon juice in a small bowl and whisk until combined.
Once potatoes are cooked, drain water and roughly chop potatoes in half.
Add harissa mix and spring onions/green onions to potatoes and stir.
In a large salad bowl, lay out arugula/rocket.
Top with potato mix and toss.
Add fetta, mint and sprinkle over pine nuts.
Adjust salt and pepper to taste.
